This is a collection of Omni-Automation plug-ins for OmniOutliner I created. The functionalities are mostly self-explainatory from filenames.

Not all codes are original. In fact I stole most of them from [omni-automation.com](https://omni-automation.com/omnioutliner/index.html) and morphed them into my own. The codes are not up to the highest standards as I'm no javascript programmer.
